## Indemnify
### Streamlined Agency Managemnt

Indemnify is a CRM specific to the needs of an independent, non-captive insurance agency. 
I began the project to fill a need for the agency I work for, but the need was filled by an existing tool. 

It uses Laravel Jetstream with Teams and uses it's authentication scaffolding.

Feel free to clone the repo and make it your own. I may continue to tinker with this project. 

You can send any questions about the code to jesselnieman@gmail.com.
